Medalhados is a wine-tasting club that mails its costumers 2 different wines every month, for blind testing and evaluation.

The costumer can then acquire the wine they tasted - and gets ranked and other benefits from participating in the app.

I've developed this app full stack, including UX/UI.

# This was one of the first times I've ever used Firebase and I have to say, it's pretty cool once you get the hang of it.

The web app was entirely build in Vue.js for the Front end and I've used Material Design as the UI base.
