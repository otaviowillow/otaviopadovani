Medalhados is a wine-tasting club that mails its costumers 2 different wines every month, for blind testing and evaluation.

The costumer can then acquire the wine they tasted - and gets ranked and other benefits from participating in the app.

I've developed this app **full stack, including UX/UI**.

# This was one of the first times I've ever used Firebase and I have to say, it's pretty cool once you get the hang of it.

The web app was entirely build in **Vue.js** for the Front end and I've used **Material Design** as the UI base.
