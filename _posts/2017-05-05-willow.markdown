Willow is a small company based on Vancouver, BC that specializes in apps and games.

Their first game, \*\*Save me, Hades! \*\*is a Google Cardboard game that won the 2016 Archiact Global Jam Award.

# The bird part at the site intro was developed using three.js, a library that specializes in making WebGL more accessible to develop on

It was my first time using **WebGL** on production and I look forward to doing more with it.
