		<p>The biggest network for hip hop on YouTube, Opposition helps content creators generate substantial revenue streams in online video. Backed by BBTV, the largest video property behind YouTube &amp; Facebook.</p>

<p>Opposition works with artists, producers, videographers, labels, and sites of all sizes. They build a support system around quality content creators who are looking to grow their presence online.</p>

<p>The cool parallax effect in the home section was done  using a small library called Parallax.js</p>

<p>The css was compiled in SASS and the code is pure semantic HTML 5, focusing on reusability of elements and simple componetization. It uses Gulp as a package manager and Wordpress as CMS.</p>
